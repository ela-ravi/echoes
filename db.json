      "originalText": "A recent study conducted by Stanford University found that remote workers are 13% more productive than their in-office counterparts. The research, which followed 16,000 workers over 9 months, also found that work-from-home employees reported higher job satisfaction and lower attrition rates. Companies implementing remote work policies saw an average of $2,000 in savings per employee on reduced office space and overhead costs.\n\nKey findings include:\n- 13% increase in productivity\n- 50% reduction in employee attrition\n- $2,000 average savings per employee\n- 9% increase in work satisfaction\n\nThe study suggests that the flexibility of remote work leads to better work-life balance and reduced commute times, contributing to overall productivity gains.",
